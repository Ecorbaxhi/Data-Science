Across multiple projects, I applied various machine learning techniques to explore and solve real-world problems using structured datasets. In the Titanic survival prediction project, I used classification models Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and SVM to predict passenger survival based on socio-demographic factors, 

evaluating model accuracy through both train-test splits and cross-validation. I also revisited linear regression to assess how different feature selections impacted fare prediction. In a clustering project, I implemented K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to group passengers into clusters and used the Elbow method to 

evaluate the optimal number of clusters. Separately, in the Employee Burnout analysis, I conducted both regression and classification modeling to identify factors contributing to high mental fatigue and to classify employees at risk. These projects helped strengthen my skills in data cleaning, transformation, model evaluation, 

and interpretationâ€”laying a solid foundation for using machine learning in business and human resource analytics
